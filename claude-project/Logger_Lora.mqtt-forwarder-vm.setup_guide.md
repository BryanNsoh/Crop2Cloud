Here's a full guide on how to use the provided script:

1. Prepare the environment:
   - Ensure you have a Linux system (preferably Ubuntu) with sudo access.
   - Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
   - Have a Google Cloud account with a project set up.

2. Set up Google Cloud credentials:
   - Create a service account in your Google Cloud project.
   - Download the JSON key file for this service account.
   - Rename the key file to "crop2cloud24-4b30f843e1cf.json".
   - Upload this file to your home directory on the Linux system.

3. Set up EMQX Cloud:
   - Ensure you have an EMQX Cloud account and a running deployment.
   - Obtain the CA certificate for your EMQX Cloud deployment.
   - Name this certificate "emqxsl-ca.crt".
   - Upload the certificate to your home directory on the Linux system.

4. Prepare the script:
   - Copy the entire bash script provided in the previous message.
   - Create a new file named "setup_emqx_to_pubsub.sh" in your home directory.
   - Paste the copied script into this file.

5. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x ~/setup_emqx_to_pubsub.sh
   ```

6. Run the script:
   ```
   ~/setup_emqx_to_pubsub.sh
   ```

7. Monitor the installation:
   - The script will update your system, install necessary packages, set up the Python environment, and create the service.
   - Watch for any error messages during the execution.

8. Check the service status:
   ```
   sudo systemctl status emqx_to_pubsub.service
   ```

9. View the logs:
   ```
   cat /home/bnsoh2/app.log
   ```

10. Test the setup:
    - Publish a message to the MQTT topic "device/data/uplink" on your EMQX Cloud deployment.
    - Check the logs to see if the message was received and published to Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

11. Troubleshooting:
    - If you encounter any issues, check the logs for error messages.
    - Ensure all credentials and certificates are correct and in the right location.
    - Verify that your Google Cloud project and EMQX Cloud deployment are properly configured.

12. Maintenance:
    - To stop the service: `sudo systemctl stop emqx_to_pubsub.service`
    - To start the service: `sudo systemctl start emqx_to_pubsub.service`
    - To restart the service: `sudo systemctl restart emqx_to_pubsub.service`

Remember to replace any placeholder values in the script with your actual configuration details before running it. This includes the EMQX Cloud host, port, username, password, and Google Cloud project details.
