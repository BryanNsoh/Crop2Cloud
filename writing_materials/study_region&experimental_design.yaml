irrigation_system:
  type: linear move Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI)
  treatments:
    - name: Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) using canopy temperatures
      details: Only one treatment was used for monitoring CWSI based on canopy temperatures.
    - name: Combination of Volumetric Water Content (VWC) and Canopy Temperatures
      details: This treatment used three depths of volumetric water content and canopy temperatures, scheduled using threshold values for both Soil Water Stress Index (SWSI) and CWSI.
    - name: Soil Water Stress Index (SWSI) thresholds only
      details: This treatment relied solely on threshold values for SWSI to guide irrigation decisions.
    - name: Fuzzy Logic System using multiple indices
      details: The fourth treatment employed evapotranspiration, crop water stress, soil water stress indices, and plant growth stages in a fuzzy logic system for irrigation decision-making.
  experimental_design:
    type: randomized complete block design (RCBD)
    blocks: 3
    plot_dimensions: 9.1 by 72.2 m
    treatments_count: 4
    special_note: One treatment was exclusively used for crop water stress index monitoring.

scheduling_criteria:
  data_sources:
    - Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)
    - Soil Water Stress Index (SWSI)
    - Evapotranspiration (ET)
  fuzzy_logic_system:
    description: Sensor data collected from canopy temperatures, soil moisture, and crop stages were transformed into CWSI and ET values for irrigation scheduling, incorporating plant growth stages into a fuzzy logic-based decision system.
